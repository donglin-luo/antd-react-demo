An engineer has ordered a special type of cuboo rock block. These blocks were very costly, so the government approved the purchase of only N number of rock blocks. The blocks are of various widths, and each block has a unit height. The design team will arrange these blocks in such a way that the total width and number of blocks at one level is less than that of the level below it. With the government decree, the team must construct the pyramid to reach the highest height in accordance with the government decree.
Write an algorithm to find the height of the pyramid that the team can build.
Input:
The first line of the input consists of an integer arr_size representing the number of rock blocks (N).
The second line consists of N space-separated integers: arr[0], arr[1], …, arr[N-1], representing the widths of each rock block.
Output:
Print an integer representing the height of the pyramid that the team can build.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr_size ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[0], arr[1], …, arr[N-1] ≤ 10^8
Example:
Input:
￼
Output:
￼
Explanation:
The number of blocks that can be placed at the top level: 30. The lower (or bottom) level: 20, 40, and 100.
